# Car-Rental-System
Event Driven Programming Group Project

### About
This repository contains a group project that was completed for the Event Driven Programming unit, during my second year at college. 

It is a car rental system that is designed to be used by an employee of Joe's Car Rentals.

Based on given requirements, myself and a colleague designed, implemented, tested and evaluated the program using the Waterfall development methodology.
The program is implemented through the use of Visual Basic, as well as some SQL querys in order to have interaction with a database. The database had the role of storing the details of vehicles on offer as well customer information (due to time constraints, the number was vehicles and existing customers pre-loaded had to be limited).

## Installation
To install the program onto your device, simply download the repository and access the program via "Joe's Car Rentals/bin/Debug/Joes Car Rentals.exe", Joes Car Rentals. The username and password to the program can be found in the text file. A few help guides, that were also created during the timeline of the project, can also be found in the Help Files directory.

## Potential Upgrades

* Allowing users to make there own accounts
* Saving user login details and customer information in an encrypted file
* Implementing correct formatting for text fields such as the driving license number
* Creating a web application to go to with the program so customers can make there own accounts and get quotes
